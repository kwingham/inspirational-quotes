Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
See ticks and crosses ✅❌

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Yes, I couldn't get filter by the author to apply, I read all that I could on manage on mdn web docs and [sup](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select#filters) but couldn't get it to work, I thought about using the tricks that I have learnt the react, but thought better of it as that wasn't covered until week06

And sharing via social media

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Lack of knowledge about the filter by the author TBH, and I didn’t attempt the sharing via social media as I am already so far behind in submitting week04s project, combined with that, its comming up to 23:00 on 18 Sept 24, so I think it is best to walk away for the day
